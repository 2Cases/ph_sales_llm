# Pharmacy Sales Chatbot Simulation

A text-based inbound pharmacy sales chatbot that simulates handling phone calls from pharmacies contacting Pharmesol, a pharmaceutical distribution company.

## Overview

This system demonstrates:
- API integration to look up existing pharmacy customers
- Personalized conversations based on pharmacy data
- Lead generation for new prospects
- Mock functions for email sending and callback scheduling
- Comprehensive error handling and edge case management

## Features

- **Pharmacy Lookup**: Integrates with external API to identify calling pharmacies
- **Personalized Conversations**: Customizes responses based on pharmacy data (volume, location)
- **Lead Generation**: Collects information from unknown callers
- **Action Handling**: Processes email requests and callback scheduling
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Includes unit tests and integration tests

## Project Structure

```
pharmechallenge/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py              # Main simulation script with demo scenarios
â”œâ”€â”€ integration.py       # API integration for pharmacy lookup
â”œâ”€â”€ llm.py              # LLM chatbot logic and conversation flow
â”œâ”€â”€ prompt.py           # System prompts and conversation templates
â”œâ”€â”€ function_calls.py   # Mock utility functions (email, callbacks)
â”œâ”€â”€ tests.py            # Comprehensive test suite
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
â””â”€â”€ README.md           # This file
```

## Installation

1. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. The OpenAI API key is already configured in the `.env` file for immediate use. If you need to change it, edit the `.env` file:
```bash
# .env file contains:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

**Note**: The `.env` file is included for demo purposes but would normally be excluded from version control for security.

## Usage

### Run Sample Scenarios
```bash
python main.py
```
This runs two demonstration scenarios:
1. Known pharmacy call (looked up from API)
2. Unknown pharmacy call (new lead generation)

### Run Complete Demo with AI
```bash
python full_demo.py
```
This runs a comprehensive demonstration with full OpenAI integration showing real AI conversations.

### Interactive Mode
```bash
python main.py interactive
```
Allows you to have a real conversation with the chatbot.

### Simulate Specific Phone Number
```bash
python main.py +1234567890
```
Simulates a call from a specific phone number.

### Run Tests
```bash
python main.py test
```
or
```bash
python tests.py
```

## API Integration

The system integrates with:
- **Pharmacy API**: `https://67e14fb758cc6bf785254550.mockapi.io/pharmacies`
- **OpenAI API**: For natural language processing and conversation

## Core Components

### 1. Integration Module (`integration.py`)
- Handles API calls to pharmacy database
- Provides pharmacy lookup by phone number
- Manages API errors and timeouts gracefully

### 2. LLM Module (`llm.py`)
- Main chatbot logic using OpenAI's API
- Conversation flow management
- Lead information extraction
- Action processing (emails, callbacks)

### 3. Prompts Module (`prompt.py`)
- System prompts for the LLM
- Conversation templates
- Response formatting utilities

### 4. Function Calls Module (`function_calls.py`)
- Mock implementations of business functions
- Email sending simulation
- Callback scheduling
- Lead logging

## Sample Conversation Flows

### Known Pharmacy
```
ðŸ¤– Great! I see you're calling from Central Pharmacy in Springfield, IL. 
   With your high prescription volume, you'd be an excellent fit for our 
   premium tier services. How can Pharmesol help you today?

ðŸ‘¤ We're interested in better pricing for high-volume pharmacies.

ðŸ¤– Perfect! With your volume, we can offer dedicated account management 
   and priority inventory allocation. Would you like me to send you 
   detailed pricing information?
```

### Unknown Pharmacy (New Lead)
```
ðŸ¤– Thank you for calling Pharmesol! I don't have your information in 
   our system yet. Could you please tell me your pharmacy name, 
   location, and monthly prescription volume?

ðŸ‘¤ I'm calling from MedCare Pharmacy in downtown Chicago. We fill 
   about 8,000 prescriptions per month.

ðŸ¤– Thank you! MedCare Pharmacy sounds like a great fit for our services. 
   With 8,000 prescriptions monthly, you'd benefit from our bulk pricing 
   and reliable delivery schedules...
```

## Testing

The test suite includes:

### Unit Tests
- API integration testing with mocked responses
- Chatbot conversation flow testing
- Mock function testing
- Edge case handling

### Integration Tests
- Real API connectivity testing (when available)
- End-to-end conversation flow testing

### Edge Cases Covered
- API timeouts and failures
- Malformed API responses
- Missing data fields
- Invalid phone numbers
- Empty user inputs
- LLM API failures

## Key Features

### 1. Pharmacy Recognition
- Automatic lookup of calling pharmacy
- Personalized greetings using pharmacy data
- Volume-based conversation customization

### 2. Lead Generation
- Information collection from unknown callers
- Email and callback scheduling
- CRM integration simulation

### 3. Error Handling
- Graceful API failure handling
- Missing data accommodation
- User-friendly error messages

### 4. Action Processing
- Email information sending
- Callback scheduling
- Lead logging and follow-up task creation

## Security Considerations

- API keys are handled securely through environment variables
- No sensitive information is logged or stored
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Error messages don't expose system internals

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Voice-to-text integration for real phone calls
- CRM system integration
- Advanced NLP for better information extraction
- Multi-language support
- Analytics and reporting features
